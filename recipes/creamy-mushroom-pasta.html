      <li>1x tablespoon of butter</li>
      <li>4x fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>1x cup of chicken stock</li>
      <li>1/2x cup of white whine</li>
      <li>1x tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1x tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1x teaspoon of salt</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil;
        add fettuccine and olive oil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet
        firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over low heat. Add mushrooms and
        cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and dark. Stir in stock, white
        wine, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt. Increase heat to medium and
        cook, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low and stir in sour cream until smooth. Stir in
        cornstarch and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in
        fettuccine or spoon sauce over servings of pasta. Top with Parmesan
        cheese.
